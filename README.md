## Description: 
This project is part of a webpage creation challenge for Prepr.
The objective was to recreate https://preprlabs.org/register and https://preprlabs.org/login pages using any framework (I chose React).
    
Additional Objectives:
- All mouseover effects need to work. But you only need to implement the following click event: register button, login button, one SSO button and drop-down menus in the sign-up form.
- The design needs to be responsive.
- You do not need to consider the accessibility button in this challenge. 
- Feel free to re-design these pages to showcase your creativity.

## Installation:
